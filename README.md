# creator-site

A self-hosted website for content creators. One application, one container, one database:

- **Links** — the public page, driven entirely by configuration
- **Chat** — multi-platform live chat, as a page and as an OBS browser source
- **Feed** — posts from every platform the creator is on, merged into one timeline
- **Calendar** — events the admin edits and viewers subscribe to over `webcal://`
- **Admin** — runs all of the above without touching files
- **Integrations** — Synchra, Discord, Cloudflare, and a plugin system for the rest

Every feature is optional and off until it is turned on. The install should be usable before it is
configured.

> **Status: early.** The scaffold and the first ported modules are in. Nothing here is deployable
> yet.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Node **26** or newer (`.nvmrc` pins it; the deployment container runs the same major).

## The gate

`npm run gate` is format check → strict lint → `npm audit` → build → type check → tests, in that
order, and it is what CI runs. One command rather than six, so CI cannot drift from what runs locally. The build
comes before the type check because Paraglide's messages and SvelteKit's types do not exist in a
fresh checkout and `svelte-check` flags every import of them.

**Strictness is the starting point, not something to migrate toward.**

- `tsconfig.json` runs `strict` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`,
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  `isolatedModules`, `noImplicitReturns` and `verbatimModuleSyntax`. The type check passes with
  **zero errors and zero warnings** or the gate fails.
- ESLint runs `strictTypeChecked` and `stylisticTypeChecked` — the type-aware tiers, not
  `recommended` — over every file, plus `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `no-console`
  (bar `console.error`), `ban-ts-comment`, and a ban on `enum` and `namespace`.
- **Size limits are enforced mechanically**, not by eye: `max-lines` 1000, `max-lines-per-function`
  100, `max-params` 5, `max-depth` 3. Tests are exempt from the line counts, because a `describe`
  block is one unit of meaning and splitting it to satisfy a counter makes a suite harder to read.
- Config files are type-checked too — `eslint.config.js` and `prettier.config.js` are in
  `tsconfig.json`'s `include`, because a lint config that silently fails to apply a rule is worse
  than not having one.

### Dependency overrides

`package.json` pins `esbuild` to `^0.28` through `overrides`. `drizzle-kit` pulls in the deprecated
`@esbuild-kit/esm-loader`, which depends on esbuild 0.18 and carries GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99. The
advisory only affects esbuild's dev server, which nothing here runs, and `npm audit fix --force`
would have downgraded `drizzle-kit` thirteen minor versions — so the transitive dependency is
forced forward instead. `npm audit` is part of the gate, so this stops being invisible if it ever
breaks.

### Suppressions

There is exactly **one** in the project, and it should stay that way. `src/app.d.ts` disables
`no-restricted-syntax` for a single line, because SvelteKit's ambient types are keyed on a global
`App` **namespace** and there is no module form of that declaration. It names the rule, covers one
line, and carries its reason above it. Any other suppression should be argued for in review.

## Toolchain notes

Everything is on its latest release except two, both held back by the ecosystem rather than by
choice:

- **TypeScript is pinned to 6.x.** TypeScript 7 breaks SvelteKit's `write_tsconfig` (it reaches for
  `ts.sys.readFile`) and ESLint's module loading. Revisit once both support it.
- **Vitest is pinned to 4.x**, because `vitest-browser-svelte` still peers on `vitest@^4`.

## Layout

```
src/lib/server/    server-only code — SvelteKit's bundler refuses to ship it to the browser
src/lib/           shared between server and client
src/routes/        pages and API routes
messages/          translation catalogues, one file per locale (en, de)
```

`src/lib/server/` is load-bearing rather than a convention: anything touching the filesystem, a
lock or a credential goes there, so an accidental client import is a build error rather than a leak.

## Continuous integration

The workflow in `.github/workflows/` is **`workflow_dispatch` only**. The automatic triggers are
present but commented out, because they do not run under the account this repository lives on — a
live `push:` trigger would queue forever and silently block anything waiting on it. Fork this
repository under an account with Actions enabled and uncomment them.
